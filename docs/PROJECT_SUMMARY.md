## Technical Deep Dive

### Monitoring Stack

**Prometheus Configuration:**
- 9 scrape jobs configured
- 15-second scrape interval
- 30-day data retention
- ~500MB storage for 1 week of data
- PromQL queries optimized for <40ms response

**Grafana Dashboards:**
- 1 custom CoreWeave Infrastructure dashboard
- 9 visualization panels
- 5-second auto-refresh
- Real-time GPU metrics tracking
- Request latency histograms (p95, p99)

**Metrics Pipeline:**
```
Source → Exporter → Prometheus → Grafana → User
  |         |           |            |
  └─────────┴───────────┴────────────┴─ Monitored at every step
```

### Key Metrics Tracked

**System Metrics (via Node Exporter):**
- CPU usage by core and mode
- Memory utilization and availability
- Disk I/O and filesystem usage
- Network throughput and errors

**Container Metrics (via cAdvisor):**
- Per-container CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O per container
- Filesystem usage per container
- Container lifecycle events

**Application Metrics (custom):**
- HTTP request rates and latency
- Active connections
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database connection pools
- Cache hit/miss ratios

**GPU Metrics (simulated):**
- GPU utilization per device (8 GPUs)
- Temperature monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Power consumption
- Error rates

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Memory Management
**Problem:** Python application experienced OOM kills (exit code 137)  
**Solution:** Implemented memory limits in docker-compose.yml (256MB max, 128MB reserved)  
**Outcome:** Stable operation with ~25MB typical usage

### 2. Metric Cardinality
**Problem:** Initial label strategy created high cardinality  
**Solution:** Optimized labels, avoided high-cardinality dimensions  
**Outcome:** Efficient storage, fast queries

### 3. Network Configuration
**Problem:** Firewall rules initially blocked external access  
**Solution:** Configured GCP firewall rules with IP restrictions  
**Outcome:** Secure external access to Grafana/Prometheus

### 4. Data Persistence
**Problem:** Container restarts lost data  
**Solution:** Implemented Docker named volumes  
**Outcome:** Data persists across restarts

## What Worked Well

### 1. Docker Compose for Rapid Prototyping
**Success:** Enabled quick iteration and testing of monitoring patterns without Kubernetes complexity.

**Evidence:**
- Full stack up and running in <30 minutes
- Easy to add/remove components
- Simple debugging with `docker logs`
- Clear service dependencies in YAML

### 2. Comprehensive Monitoring Coverage
**Success:** Tracked metrics at every layer (infrastructure, containers, applications, simulated GPUs).

**Evidence:**
- 1,145 unique metrics
- 100% target availability
- No blind spots in observability

### 3. Stable, Efficient Operation
**Success:** System ran reliably with minimal resource consumption.

**Evidence:**
- 32+ hours continuous uptime
- Only 520MB memory used (13% of available)
- <5% CPU usage
- Zero container restarts in final week

### 4. Documentation Excellence
**Success:** Created comprehensive, reusable documentation.

**Evidence:**
- README with clear setup instructions
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Operational runbook with troubleshooting
- Code comments and inline documentation

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Memory Limits are Critical
**Learning:** Always set memory limits on containers, especially custom applications.

**Application:** Added `deploy.resources.limits.memory` to prevent OOM kills. In Kubernetes, this translates to resource requests/limits in pod specs.

### 2. Labels are Powerful but Dangerous
**Learning:** Label cardinality directly impacts query performance and storage.

**Application:** Used labels for filtering (gpu_id, endpoint), avoided high-cardinality labels (timestamps, user IDs). This pattern carries forward to Kubernetes where label strategy is even more critical.

### 3. Monitoring Systems Need Monitoring
**Learning:** The monitoring system itself needs health checks and alerts.

**Application:** Created health check scripts, monitored Prometheus with itself (`up` metric), tracked query performance. Essential for production systems.

### 4. Documentation is Not Optional
**Learning:** Good documentation multiplies the value of technical work.

**Application:** Invested time in comprehensive docs. Made troubleshooting easier, knowledge transfer possible, and portfolio presentation professional.

## Why Kubernetes Next?

### Docker Compose Limitations

**Single Point of Failure:**
- All containers on one host
- No automatic failover
- Manual recovery required

**No Auto-Scaling:**
- Static resource allocation
- Can't scale based on metrics
- Manual scaling only

**Limited Service Discovery:**
- Static configuration
- No dynamic target addition
- Manual updates required

### Kubernetes Advantages

**High Availability:**
- Multi-node deployment
- Automatic pod rescheduling
- Self-healing systems

**Auto-Scaling:**
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Cluster Autoscaler
- Metrics-driven scaling

**Service Discovery:**
- ServiceMonitors for auto-discovery
- DNS-based service resolution
- Dynamic configuration

**Production Patterns:**
- Helm charts for deployment
- GitOps with ArgoCD
- RBAC for security
- Ingress for traffic routing

---

## Phase 2: Kubernetes Migration

### Planned Improvements

**Infrastructure:**
- Migrate to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Deploy kube-prometheus-stack via Helm
- Use StatefulSets for Prometheus/Grafana
- DaemonSet for node-exporter

**Application:**
- Deploy vLLM for real LLM inference
- Monitor actual GPU workloads (not simulated)
- Use real models (TinyLlama or Phi-2)
- Generate actual inference metrics

**Monitoring:**
- ServiceMonitor for auto-discovery
- AlertManager integration
- Grafana Loki for logs
- Custom alerts and runbooks

**Operations:**
- Helm chart for entire stack
- GitOps deployment workflow
- Automated backups
- Multi-environment support
